## x/x/18

##### `redux-resource@3.0.0`

**Breaking Changes**

* The `NULL` request status has been renamed to `IDLE`. The request action types (such as `READ_RESOURCES_NULL`) have
  been updated to reflect this new name.

* As a consequence of the above change, `getStatus` will now return an object with an `idle` key rather than a `null` key.

* The deprecated `getResources()` signature that accepted three arguments has been removed.

* Omitting a `filter` when calling `getResources` now returns all of the resources in the slice.

* Four action types have been reserved for a future minor release of Redux Resource: `REQUEST_IDLE`, `REQUEST_PENDING`,
  `REQUEST_SUCCEEDED`, and `REQUEST_FAILED`. Using these action types will cause a warning to be logged, and will
  conflict with an upcoming update to the library.

**New Features**

* The `resourceType` is now stored on the resource slice.

* There are two new action types for directly modifying resource data independent from requests: `UPDATE_RESOURCES`
  and `DELETE_RESOURCES`.

**Deprecations**

* Using the `resourceName` property on actions. Use `resourceType` instead.

## 2/8/18

##### `redux-resource@2.4.1`

* IDs that were a the number `0` would cause error messages to be logged in certain situations. Also,
  they would not be deleted when using the built-in delete action type. This issue has been resolved.

##### `redux-resource-action-creators@1.0.1`

* The file names for the UMD builds were incorrect. Previously, it was `redux-resource-prop-types.min.js`.
  Now, it is `redux-resource-action-creators.min.js`.

  This change should not impact Webpack, Node, nor Browserify users. It only impacts developers who were
  using this path directly in their application code.

## 12/9/17

##### `redux-resource-action-creators@1.0.0`

* This new library that may help you create valid Redux Resource action. For more,
  see [the documentation](https://redux-resource.js.org/docs/extras/redux-resource-action-creators.html).

## 10/24/17

##### `redux-resource@2.3.1`

##### `redux-resource-xhr@2.1.0`

**New Features**

* You can now customize the query string serializer by using the
  `qsStringify` and `qsStringifyOptions` XHR options. For more, refer

## 10/11/17

##### `@2.0.0`

> Note: No changes were made from `2.0.0-beta1`.

Here is a summary of changes between 1.0.x and 2.0.0:

**Breaking Changes**

* `getResources` now returns resources from lists, rather than requests.
* The `labels` section of a slice has been renamed to be `requests`.
* The library has been renamed from `resourceful-redux` to be `redux-resource`

**New Features**

* The `resourceful-redux` library now supports lists, which separates two use
  cases both previously managed by `labels`. Lists are designed to track ordered
  collections of resources, like results from a search or a 'most popular books'.
  Labels are now able to focus solely on named requests that aren't necessarily
  tied to specific resources (e.g. to track the creation of new resources that
  may not have IDs yet). For more info, refer to #187 or read further in
  our [docs](https://resourceful-redux.js.org/).
* Loading Redux Resource in browser global environments (when you're not using
  Webpack, Browserify, Rollup, or another bundler like these) now works.
* The reset plugin now supports resetting a list and/or a request, or the entire
  state slice.

## 9/12/17

##### `resourceful-xhr@1.2.0`

**New Features**

  still supported, but it will be removed in resourceful-xhr@2.0.0.

##### `resourceful-xhr@2.0.0`
