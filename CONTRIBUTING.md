and we'll do our best to help out.

To begin contributing, you'll first need to
[clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/),

### Contributing to the Code

This repository contains the main Resourceful Redux library (`resourceful-redux`
on npm), as well as extras 
(["Ecosystem Extras"](https://resourceful-redux.js.org/)) that can be useful when
using Resourceful Redux. Each package has its own directory within the
`packages` directory of this repository.

Find the library you're interested in updating, and make changes as you see fit.
As you work, and/or when you're done, run `npm test` to lint your changes, and
to run the unit tests.

Once you're done, go ahead and open a Pull Request.

> :information_desk_person: Don't sweat it if you can't get the tests to pass,
or if you can't finish the changes you'd like to make. If you still open up a
Pull Request, we'll make sure it gets figured out.

### Contributing to the Website

The source code for the site lives in the `docs` directory.

Run `npm run docs:watch` to start up the local version of the site at
`http://localhost:4000`. As you make changes to the source, your local version
of the website will automatically update and refresh your browser.

Once you're done, commit your changes and open a Pull Request. Also, thanks!
