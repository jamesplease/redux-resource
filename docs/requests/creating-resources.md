# Creating Resources

Redux Resource provides four [action types](./request-actions.md) for
creating resources asynchronously. They are:

```js
"CREATE_RESOURCES_PENDING"
"CREATE_RESOURCES_FAILED"
"CREATE_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED"
"CREATE_RESOURCES_IDLE"
```

Each request will always begin with an action with type
`CREATE_RESOURCES_PENDING`. Then, one of the other three action types will be
used to represent the resolution of that request. Use the other action types in the
following way:

- `CREATE_RESOURCES_FAILED`: Use this if the request fails for any reason. This
  could be network errors, or any
  [HTTP Status Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
  greater than or equal to 400.
- `CREATE_RESOURCES_IDLE`: Use this when the request is aborted.
- `CREATE_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED`: Use this when the request was successful.

### Request Objects

Specifying a [request key](/docs/requests/request-keys.md) on the actions will create a
request object in the store for this request. This object can be used to look up
the [status](/docs/requests/request-statuses.md) of the request.

For many create requests, you don't have the ID of the resource being created
until after the operation succeeds. Therefore, to track the status of the
request, you will need to specify the request key so that the status can be
stored on the request object.

Many interfaces only allow one creation request at a time (although that
request may be for a bulk creation). In these situations, you can just use a
single request key, such as `"create"`, for all of your creation requests.

### Successful Creates

When an action of type `CREATE_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED` is dispatched, three things
will happen:

1. the resources included in the action's `resources` will be added to the
  `resources` section of the resource slice. Existing resources with the same ID
  will be merged with the new ones. To replace existing resources, rather than
  merge them, specify `mergeResources: false` on the action.

2. The metadata for each of the `resources` specified on the action will be updated
  with  `createStatus: 'SUCCEEDED'`. To replace all of the existing meta, rather than
  merging it, specify `mergeMeta: false` on the action.

3. When a `list` is passed, the IDs from the `resources` array on the action will
  added to the list. You may specify `mergeListIds: false` to _replace_ the existing
  list instead.

### Redux Resource XHR

[Redux Resource XHR](/docs/extras/redux-resource-xhr.md) 
provides an action creator that simplifies making CRUD requests. If you'd like to
build your own, then that's fine, too. The example below may help.

### Example Action Creator

This example shows an action creator to create a single book. It uses the
[redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) middleware and the
library [xhr](https://github.com/naugtur/xhr) for making requests.

```js
import { actionTypes } from 'redux-resource';
import xhr from 'xhr';

export default function createBook(bookDetails) {
  return function(dispatch) {
    dispatch({
      type: actionTypes.CREATE_RESOURCES_PENDING,
      resourceType: 'books',
      requestKey: 'create',
    });

    const req = xhr.post(
      '/books',
      {
        json: bookDetails
      },
      (err, res, body) => {
        if (req.aborted) {
          dispatch({
            type: actionTypes.CREATE_RESOURCES_IDLE,
            resourceType: 'books',
            requestKey: 'create',
          });
        } else if (err || res.statusCode >= 400) {
          dispatch({
            type: actionTypes.CREATE_RESOURCES_FAILED,
            resourceType: 'books',
            requestKey: 'create',
            requestProperties: {
              statusCode: res.statusCode 
            }
          });
        } else {
          dispatch({
            type: actionTypes.CREATE_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,
            resourceType: 'books',
            requestKey: 'create',
            resources: [body],
            requestProperties: {
              statusCode: res.statusCode 
            }
          });
        }
      }
    );

    return req;
  }
}
```
