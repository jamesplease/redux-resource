# Actions

#### Should all Actions have labels?

We recommend only using labels when they're necessary. The two most common use
cases we use labels for are:

1. creating resources
2. multiple bulk reads of the same resource type on the same page

If using the label isn't providing value for a specific operation, then you
probably don't need to use one.
