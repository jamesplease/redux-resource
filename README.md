# Resourceful Redux

A tiny but powerful system for managing 'resources': data that is persisted to
remote servers.

### Installation

To install the latest stable version:

```
npm install --save resourceful-redux
```

### Size

Resourceful Redux is around 2kb gzipped, which is typically _much_ smaller than
the boilerplate code that it replaces.

### Documentation

View the documentation at
**[resourceful-redux.js.org ⇗](https://resourceful-redux.js.org/)**.

### Quick Start

Follow this guide to get a taste of what it's like to work with Resourceful
Redux.

First, we set up our store with a "resource reducer," which is a reducer that
manages the state for one type of resource. In this guide, our reducer will
handle the data for our "books" resource.

```js
import { store, combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { resourceReducer } from 'resourceful-redux';

const reducer = combineReducers({
  books: resourceReducer('books')
});

const store = createStore(reducer);
```

Once we have a store, we can start dispatching actions to it. In this example,
we initiate a request to read a book with an ID of 24, then follow it up with an
action representing success. There are two actions, because requests usually
occur over a network, and therefore take time to complete.

```js
import { actionTypes } from 'resourceful-redux';
import store from './store';

// This action represents beginning the request to read a book with ID of 24.
store.dispatch({
  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_PENDING,
  resourceName: 'books',
  resources: [24]
});

// Later, when the request succeeds, we dispatch the success action.
store.dispatch({
  type: actionTypes.READ_RESOURCES_SUCCEEDED,
  resourceName: 'books',
  resources: [{
    id: 24,
    title: 'My Name is Red',
    releaseYear: 1998,
    author: 'Orhan Pamuk'
  }]
});
```

Later, in your view layer, you can access information about the status of
this request. When it succeeds, accessing the returned book is straightforward.

```js
import { getStatus } from 'resourceful-redux';
import store from './my-store';

const state = store.getState();
// The second argument to this method is a path into the state. This method
// protects you from needing to check for undefined values.
const readStatus = getStatus(store, 'books.meta.24.readStatus');

if (readStatus.pending) {
  console.log('The request is in flight.');
}

else if (readStatus.failed) {
  console.log('The request failed.');
}

else if (readStatus.succeeded) {
  const book = state.books.resources[24];

  console.log('The book was retrieved successfully, and here is the data:', book);
}
```

This is just a small sample of what it's like working with Resourceful Redux.
